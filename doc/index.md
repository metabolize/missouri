## History

This friendly API was developed at Body Labs for an library called
[baiji-serialization][] which provided one-line reading and writing of objects
to JSON and YAML files and S3 keys on top of [baiji][] (may it rest in peace).

baiji is a river dolphin of the Yangtze; boto is a river dolphin of the Amazon.
This library is not named after a dolphin, but it is named after a different big
river.
